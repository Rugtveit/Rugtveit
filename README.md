## Projects

### QuestPackages
A simple full stack project, that caches the packages from qpackages.com
and saves it to a database. This is because the current api qpackages.com has is limiting for frontend.

The [Frontend](https://github.com/Rugtveit/questpackages-frontend) is written in Next.JS, Typescript and CSS for styling.  
And the [Backend](https://github.com/Rugtveit/questpackages-backend) is written in ASP.Net Core 5.0 and uses MongoDB for database. 

You can see the live deployment on https://questpackages.com
