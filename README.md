### Hi there ðŸ‘‹.<br/>
I'm a self-taught programmer, with C#, and C++ knowledge. <br/>
I'm working on new projects to become a full-stack developer <br/>

# Current Projects
## QuestPackages
A simple full stack project, that caches the packages from qpackages.com
and saves it to a database. This is because the current api qpackages.com has is limiting for frontend.

The [Frontend](https://github.com/Rugtveit/questpackages-frontend) is written in Next.JS, Typescript and CSS for styling.  
And the [Backend](https://github.com/Rugtveit/questpackages-backend) is written in ASP.Net Core 5.0 and uses MongoDB for database.
