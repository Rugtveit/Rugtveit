### Hi there ðŸ‘‹.<br/>
I code in C++ and C#, but have a goal of learning HTML, CSS and JS for web development. <br/>
I code in my freetime, and create mods for Beat Saber.

# Mods 
- [No360HUD](https://github.com/Rugtveit/No360HUD "No360HUD") <br/> Disables 360 HUD for maps that have no valid rotation events on PC for Beat Saber. 
- [QuestSounds](https://github.com/Rugtveit/QuestSounds "QuestSounds") <br/> Allows the user to change sfx easily on Oculus Quest for Beat Saber.
